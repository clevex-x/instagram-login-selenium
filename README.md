This is a simple automation script that demonstrates how to simulate a login attempt on the Instagram website using Python and Selenium WebDriver.

üîç The script performs:

Entry of valid/invalid login credentials

Detection of input fields using CSS Selectors

Safe test without actually submitting login (to avoid account bans)

Screenshot capture for visual validation

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer:
This project is created for learning purposes only. It does not perform real logins or interact with Instagram beyond educational testing. I'm still new to QA automation and using this to practice Selenium basics.
